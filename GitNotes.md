# How to use Git Commands
## Specifically the ones we learned in Bander's class...



### Clone a repo
To Clone a repo 
`git clone <HTTPS link from the Green Code Button in repo>`

##Pushing Data to Github
### Add
Add all of the changes to a commit
`git add .`
- be sure you are in the root directory of the repo
- the . stands for everything

### Commit
Generate a commit message/description of what changed and commit them to your project.
`git commit -m "what is changing"`
- the quotes are for you to tell us what you did. If you don't know then you need to recap what you did for the day ... Be descriptive... It will potentially save your butt later...

### Push
Actually send your changes to the cloud
`git push`
- IF you get a merge conflict warning, come see Bander


## Pull data from GitHub
`git pull`

`git status` checks if your repo is behind or ahead of the cloud

`git fetch` checks what is different with GitHub (specifically for branches)
